# RowTranspositionCipher

This repository contains Java code for Row Transposition Cipher encryption and decryption. It includes a JavaFX application for interactive use and a core encryption class.

## Usage

To use the Row Transposition Cipher, you can run the JavaFX application provided in the `RowTransposition.java` file. Follow the instructions on the application's graphical user interface to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Core Encryption Class

The core encryption logic is implemented in the `RowTransClass.java` file. You can use this class in your own Java projects for Row Transposition Cipher operations.

## How it Works

The Row Transposition Cipher is a simple encryption technique that rearranges the characters in a message based on a numeric key. This repository provides a practical implementation of the algorithm.
